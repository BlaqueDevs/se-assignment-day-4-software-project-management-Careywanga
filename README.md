This can be done by proper scheduling of how you will tackle you project, collaborating with your teams and avoiding postponin work.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
1. ensures the projects stay within the budget
2. Allow minimal resource allocation
3. Early identification of possible overruns
4. ensures measures to cub financial risks

Overruns can be prevented by;1. ccost sontrol in areas exceeding expectations.
2. Monitoring expenses against the project budget
3. helps to minimise budgets

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile methodology allows flexibility and collaboration whereby teams can work around the project to meet the customer satisfaction while waterfall uses a linear methodology where you must finish one unit before going to the next.
Agile teams work together hence inclusive, waterfall - every unit has to be completed first which might not be inclusive of a large team
Agile mighthave a nu,ber of bugs from different team members while in waterfall a bug is detected before you proceed to the next unit.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Waterfall might do well when building a single application or biulding a structure while agile can be better when building large software projects thet need team work to meet deadlines.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
1. software testing
2. continous improvement
3. metrics and measurements
4. Q and A testing
5. continous integration practices
   
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?

Building a healthy nation

## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
Videos showing how to make healthy food, recipes and what to avoid

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
The food stuffs to be taken, tools needed for preparation, preservation methods

## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
Understanding the target market in different places, what is available, age will help specify what recipes to direct.
